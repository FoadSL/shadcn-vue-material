## November 2025 - Catch up

We've upgraded [shadcn-vue.com](/) to Nuxt v4 and Tailwind v4. The site now uses the upgraded `new-york` components.

We've also made some minor design updates to make the site faster and easier to navigate.

### Chart

We also refactored the [Chart](/docs/chart) component to match the original component, and stick to the API as close as possible.

## October 2025 - New Components

For this round of components, I looked at what we build every day, the boring stuff we rebuild over and over, and made reusable abstractions you can actually use.

- [Spinner](#spinner): An indicator to show a loading state.
- [Kbd](#kbd): Display a keyboard key or group of keys.
- [Button Group](#button-group): A group of buttons for actions and split buttons.
- [Input Group](#input-group): Input with icons, buttons, labels and more.
- [Field](#field): One component. All your forms.
- [Item](#item): Display lists of items, cards, and more.
- [Empty](#empty): Use this one for empty states.

### Spinner

Okay let's start with the easiest ones: **Spinner** and **Kbd**. Pretty basic. We all know what they do.

Here's how you render a spinner:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Spinner } from '@/components/ui/spinner'
</script>

<template>
  <Spinner />
</template>
```

Here's what it looks like:

::component-preview
---
name: SpinnerBasic
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[250px] [&_pre]:!h-[250px]"
---
::

Here's what it looks like in a button:

::component-preview
---
name: SpinnerButtonDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[250px] [&_pre]:!h-[250px]"
---
::

You can edit the code and replace it with your own spinner.

::component-preview
---
name: SpinnerCustomDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[250px] [&_pre]:!h-[250px]"
---
::

### Kbd

Kbd is a component that renders a keyboard key.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Kbd, KbdGroup } from '@/components/ui/kbd'
</script>

<template>
  <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd>
</template>
```

Use `KbdGroup` to group keyboard keys together.

```vue showLineNumbers
<template>
  <KbdGroup>
    <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd>
    <Kbd>B</Kbd>
  </KbdGroup>
</template>
```

::component-preview
---
name: KbdDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[250px] [&_pre]:!h-[250px]"
---
::

You can add it to buttons, tooltips, input groups, and more.

### Button Group

I got a lot of requests for this one: Button Group. It's a container that groups related buttons together with consistent styling. Great for action groups, split buttons, and more.

::component-preview
---
name: ButtonGroupDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[250px] [&_pre]:!h-[250px]"
---
::

Here's the code:

```vue showLineNumbers
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ButtonGroup } from '@/components/ui/button-group'
</script>

<template>
  <ButtonGroup>
    <Button>Button 1</Button>
    <Button>Button 2</Button>
  </ButtonGroup>
</template>
```

You can nest button groups to create more complex layouts with spacing.

```vue showLineNumbers
<template>
  <ButtonGroup>
    <ButtonGroup>
      <Button>Button 1</Button>
      <Button>Button 2</Button>
    </ButtonGroup>
    <ButtonGroup>
      <Button>Button 3</Button>
      <Button>Button 4</Button>
    </ButtonGroup>
  </ButtonGroup>
</template>
```

Use `ButtonGroupSeparator` to create split buttons. Classic dropdown pattern.

::component-preview
---
name: ButtonGroupWithDropdownMenuDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[250px] [&_pre]:!h-[250px]"
---
::

You can also use it to add prefix or suffix buttons and text to inputs.

::component-preview
---
name: ButtonGroupWithSelectDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[250px] [&_pre]:!h-[250px]"
---
::

```vue showLineNumbers
<template>
  <ButtonGroup>
    <ButtonGroupText>Prefix</ButtonGroupText>
    <Input placeholder="Type something here..." />
    <Button>Button</Button>
  </ButtonGroup>
</template>
```

### Input Group

Input Group lets you add icons, buttons, and more to your inputs. You know, all those little bits you always need around your inputs.

```vue showLineNumbers
<script setup lang="ts">
import { InputGroup, InputGroupAddon, InputGroupInput } from '@/components/ui/input-group'
</script>

<template>
  <InputGroup>
    <InputGroupInput placeholder="Search..." />
    <InputGroupAddon>
      <SearchIcon />
    </InputGroupAddon>
  </InputGroup>
</template>
```

Here's a preview with icons:

::component-preview
---
name: InputGroupWithIcon
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[300px] [&_pre]:!h-[300px]"
---
::

You can also add buttons to the input group.

::component-preview
---
name: InputGroupWithButton
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[300px] [&_pre]:!h-[300px]"
---
::

Or text, labels, tooltips,...

::component-preview
---
name: InputGroupWithText
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[350px] [&_pre]:!h-[350px]"
---
::

It also works with textareas so you can build really complex components with lots of knobs and dials or yet another prompt form.

::component-preview
---
name: InputGroupWithTextarea
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[450px] [&_pre]:!h-[450px]"
---
::

Oh here are some cool ones with spinners:

::component-preview
---
name: InputGroupWithSpinner
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[350px] [&_pre]:!h-[350px]"
---
::

### Field

Introducing **Field**, a component for building really complex forms. The abstraction here is beautiful.

It took me a long time to get it right but I made it work with all your form libraries: Vee Validate, TanStack Form, Bring Your Own Form.

Here's a basic field with an input:

```vue showLineNumbers
<script setup lang="ts">
import {
  Field,
  FieldDescription,
  FieldError,
  FieldLabel,
} from '@/components/ui/field'
</script>

<template>
  <Field>
    <FieldLabel html-for="username">
      Username
    </FieldLabel>
    <Input id="username" placeholder="Max Leiter" />
    <FieldDescription>
      Choose a unique username for your account.
    </FieldDescription>
  </Field>
</template>
```

::component-preview
---
name: FieldInputDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[350px] [&_pre]:!h-[350px]"
---
::

It works with all form controls. Inputs, textareas, selects, checkboxes, radios, switches, sliders, you name it. Here's a full example:

::component-preview
---
name: FieldDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[850px] [&_pre]:!h-[850px]"
---
::

Here are some checkbox fields:

::component-preview
---
name: FieldCheckboxDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[500px] [&_pre]:!h-[500px]"
---
::

You can group fields together using `FieldGroup` and `FieldSet`. Perfect for
multi-section forms.

```vue showLineNumbers
<template>
  <FieldSet>
    <FieldLegend />
    <FieldGroup>
      <Field />
      <Field />
    </FieldGroup>
  </FieldSet>
</template>
```

::component-preview
---
name: FieldFieldsetDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[500px] [&_pre]:!h-[500px]"
---
::

Making it responsive is easy. Use `orientation="responsive"` and it switches
between vertical and horizontal layouts based on container width. Done.

::component-preview
---
name: FieldResponsiveDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[600px] [&_pre]:!h-[600px]"
---
::

Wait here's more. Wrap your fields in `FieldLabel` to create a selectable field group. Really easy. And it looks great.

::component-preview
---
name: FieldChoiceCardDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[600px] [&_pre]:!h-[600px]"
---
::

### Item

This one is a straightforward flex container that can house nearly any type of content.

I've built this so many times that I decided to create a component for it. Now I use it all the time. I use it to display lists of items, cards, and more.

Here's a basic item:

```vue showLineNumbers
<script setup lang="ts">
import {
  Item,
  ItemContent,
  ItemDescription,
  ItemMedia,
  ItemTitle,
} from '@/components/ui/item'
</script>

<template>
  <Item>
    <ItemMedia variant="icon">
      <HomeIcon />
    </ItemMedia>
    <ItemContent>
      <ItemTitle>Dashboard</ItemTitle>
      <ItemDescription>Overview of your account and activity.</ItemDescription>
    </ItemContent>
  </Item>
</template>
```

::component-preview
---
name: ItemDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[300px] [&_.preview]:p-4 [&_pre]:!h-[300px]"
---
::

You can add icons, avatars, or images to the item.

::component-preview
---
name: ItemIconDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[300px] [&_.preview]:p-4 [&_pre]:!h-[300px]"
---
::

::component-preview
---
name: ItemAvatarDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[300px] [&_.preview]:p-4 [&_pre]:!h-[300px]"
---
::

And here's what a list of items looks like with `ItemGroup`:

::component-preview
---
name: ItemGroupDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[500px] [&_.preview]:p-4 [&_pre]:!h-[500px]"
---
::

Need it as a link? Use the `asChild` prop:

```vue showLineNumbers
<template>
  <Item as-child>
    <a href="/dashboard">
      <ItemMedia variant="icon">
        <HomeIcon />
      </ItemMedia>
      <ItemContent>
        <ItemTitle>Dashboard</ItemTitle>
        <ItemDescription>Overview of your account and activity.</ItemDescription>
      </ItemContent>
    </a>
  </Item>
</template>
```

::component-preview
---
name: ItemLinkDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[400px] [&_.preview]:p-4 [&_pre]:!h-[400px]"
---
::

### Empty

Okay last one: **Empty**. Use this to display empty states in your app.

Here's how you use it:

```vue showLineNumbers
<script setup lang="ts">
import {
  Empty,
  EmptyContent,
  EmptyDescription,
  EmptyMedia,
  EmptyTitle,
} from '@/components/ui/empty'
</script>

<template>
  <Empty>
    <EmptyMedia variant="icon">
      <InboxIcon />
    </EmptyMedia>
    <EmptyTitle>No messages</EmptyTitle>
    <EmptyDescription>You don't have any messages yet.</EmptyDescription>
    <EmptyContent>
      <Button>Send a message</Button>
    </EmptyContent>
  </Empty>
</template>
```

::component-preview
---
name: EmptyDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[400px] [&_.preview]:p-4 [&_pre]:!h-[400px]"
---
::

You can use it with avatars:

::component-preview
---
name: EmptyAvatarDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[400px] [&_pre]:!h-[400px]"
---
::

Or with input groups for things like search results or email subscriptions:

::component-preview
---
name: EmptyInputGroupDemo
class: "[&_.preview]:h-[450px] [&_pre]:!h-[450px]"
---
::

That's it. Seven new components. Works with all your libraries. Ready for your projects.

## February 2025 - Reka UI & npx shadcn-vue@latest init

We've updated the latest registry to support Reka UI instead of Radix Vue.

The updated CLI is now available. You can now install components, themes, composables, utils and more using `npx shadcn-vue add`.

This is a major step towards distributing code that you and your LLMs can access and use.

::callout
With the released of [Reka UI v2](https://reka-ui.com/), `shadcn-vue@latest` command will now install Reka UI. If you want to keep using [Radix Vue](https://radix-vue.com/), please visit [here](https://radix.shadcn-vue.com/) and run `shadcn-vue@radix` command instead.
::

1. First up, when you init into a new app, we update your existing Tailwind files instead of overriding.
2. A component now ship its own dependencies. Take the accordion for example, it can define its Tailwind keyframes. When you add it to your project, we’ll update your tailwind.config.ts file accordingly.
3. You can also install remote components using url. `npx shadcn-vue add https://acme.com/registry/navbar.json`.
<!-- 4. We have also improve the init command. It does framework detection and can even init a brand new Next.js app in one command. `npx shadcn init`. -->
4. We have created a new schema that you can use to ship your own component registry. And since it has support for urls, you can even use it to distribute private components.
5. And a few more updates like better error handling and monorepo support.

You can try the new cli today.

```bash
npx shadcn-vue@latest init Sidebar01 Login01
```
